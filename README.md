# BayesianModelComparisonsRCode

The code is organised into the analysis carried out in the manuscript.
1. Uncensored simulation analysis
2. Censored simulation analysis
3. Mongoose data analysis

To run the code for each analysis, the folder structure of the code files needs to match that of the repository, then follow the below instructions.

## Uncensored simulation analysis - 
set working directory to: 'SimDataAnalysis/Analysis'
Run each of the files in this folder.

## Censored simulation analysis -
set working directory to: 'SimCensoredDataAnalysis/Analysis'
Run each of the files in this folder.

## Mongoose data analysis -
Download the data and upload to the empty 'MongooseDataAnalysis/Data' folder
We suggest starting a new R session for each of the analyses.

### Initial Model Comparison
set working directory to: 'MongooseDataAnalysis/InitialModelComparison'
Run the Setup file
Open the ModelFitting folder and run each file, outputs will be saved to the output folder.
Run the post file
Outputs will be saved in the output folder that the code creates.

### Sex Specific Comparison
set working directory to: 'MongooseDataAnalysis/SexSpecific'
Run the Setup file
Open the ModelFitting folder and run each file, outputs will be saved to the output folder.
Run the post file
Outputs will be saved in the output folder that the code creates.

### Initial Model Comparison
set working directory to: 'MongooseDataAnalysis/EscortSpecific'
Run the Setup file
Open the ModelFitting folder and run each file, outputs will be saved to the output folder.
Run the post file
Outputs will be saved in the output folder that the code creates.
